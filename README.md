# All Things RL 

`agents.py` : simple versions of some RL agent algorithms

`environments.py` : Test environments to run these algorithms (so far only k-Armed Bandits though)

Sorry, that's all the docs there are, I leave you now with Jabberwocky, by Lewis Carroll:

>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
>      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
>      And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>

>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
>      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
>      The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br>

>He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
>      Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
>So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
>      And stood awhile in thought.<br>

>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
>      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
>      And burbled as it came!<br>

>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
>      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
>He left it dead, and with its head<br>
>      He went galumphing back.<br>

>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
>      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
>      He chortled in his joy.<br>

>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
>      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
>      And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
